              Web development is the work involved in developing a website for
              the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
              network).Web development can range from developing a simple single
              static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
              businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
              of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
              engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
              client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
              configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web
              professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
              non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and
              coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS)
              to make content changes easier and available with basic technical
              skills.

              Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
              for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
              defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
              assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
              scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
              documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
              documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
              of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
              appearance.

              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
              specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
              markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such
              as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
              World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to
              enable the separation of content and presentation, including
              layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
              accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more
              flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
              characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
              specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
              complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
              the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
              the pages that share the file and its formatting.

              JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
              core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of
              websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
              Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the
              client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a
              variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser
              usage is Node.js.
